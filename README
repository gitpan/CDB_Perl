CDB_Perl version 0.01
=====================

CDB_Perl is a perl only (pure perl) implementation of utilities related to the CDB fileformat (constant database).

The work is fully functional and no major changes in the interface are expected in the future.
For examples have a look at the eg directory in the distribution

This should work for any version >= 5.6 but 5.4 onwards might be fine though the test won't run.
PerlIO is a nice to have but it should now work even in systems where it isn't available.
